the website.

Bug #2:
Details:
I have noticed that when the user changes the size of the browser then the clouds at the 
home section gets a bit messed up and lay on top of each other. I would like to keep the 
clouds next to each other even if the users are on their phone.  

Possible Approaches:
* Try to check the column sizing.

Bug #3:
Details:
I would like to prepare a slideshow that could be used to display the products offered by 
the company. 

Possible Approaches:
* The only approach I could think of at the moment is to use the same trick I was taught 
  in the Udemy courses. The slideshow is also known as a carousel.
